	<h1>All about Sagittarius's and why I like them!</h1>

	<p>First, Sagittraius is a fire sign, which I love. Fire and air signs are the best signs, and there is no debate. Sagittarius's are optimistic and love freedom. they are su fun to be with because they are spotaneous and hilarious. They are one of the most outgoing and conversationalist zodiac signs. Some Sagittarius's that are in our grade are: Lola, Annabelle, Ella, Margot, Ally, and Alexis. Some famous Sagittarius's are: Jules LeBlanc, Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Avani Gregg, Nicki Minaj, Miley Cyrus, and Britney Spears. I love Sagittarius's! </p>
